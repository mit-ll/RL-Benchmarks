# 🐳 Docker Notes

## 🎼  Docker Compose
* Allows you to create multiple different builds using different Docker files.
* The context directory can be set from the `docker_compose.yml` file.
* More options than a standard Docker file.

## 👟 Running Commands
* In Docker each `RUN` command is treated as a new shell instance.  This means that commands cannot persist across different RUN commands.

```Docker
RUN command1    # this command is run in its own shell!
RUN command2    # this command is run in its own shell!
```

## 🗃️ Copying Folders/Files
* If you need to copy files or directories into the Docker container, first put them in an **artifacts** directory that can be seen from the context directory.

```Docker
COPY <artifact_directory> <container_path>
```
## 📂 Context Directory

* By default Dockerfiles are only aware of what is in their **context directory**.  A context directory is the directory where a Dockerfile is located in.  It cannot access any files outside of the context directory.

* The context directory can be set from the command line or from a `docker_compose.yml` file.

* It is recommended that all folders/files be copied be placed in an **artifacts** directory that is under the context directory.

## 💾 Out of Memory
* Occasionally you will need to clean your docker images and docker volumes in order to recover memory.

```console
docker volume prune
docker image prune
docker container prune
```
